Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Clone it's like you want get copy repository on your PC. Fork it's when you copy repository on your account on GitHub without clone this repository on your own PC. Branches -  is the duplication of an object under revision control ) so that modifications can happen in parallel along both branches.
