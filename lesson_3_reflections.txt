When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    It was when i search my fist job


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Sometimes you need to pull, because if this not do in the future will be heavy merge with your files


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Clone it's like you want get copy repository on your PC. Fork it's when you copy repository on your account on GitHub without clone this repository on your own PC. Branches -  is the duplication of an object under revision control ) so that modifications can happen in parallel along both branches.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    If I am about to go without Internet access for a while, for example to work on a plane, I can update my local copy before I leave.  I can do this even if I'm not ready to merge those changes into my own branches yet.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    When you would be work without Git or GitHub you need create folder with files and add to this folder txt file with instruction. It easy for one side because he does change and create folder with new files, for second side it's very difficult because you need merge all changes with master.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

    When you work with big project usually this is small team, for example markup, front-end back-end and all this gays have branch for tasks, if all  this people would be work in master branch. They'll be have a lot of conflicts and this work slow.
