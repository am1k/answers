When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    It was when i search my fist job

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Sometimes you need to pull, because if this not do in the future will be heavy merge with your files
